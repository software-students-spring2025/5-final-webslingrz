# About
![Bird Image](backend/static/hook.png)
### Silly game about silly birds!üêî
Do you like birds but you wish they wouldn't fly away the moment you got near them? Do you wonder if there is a way to interact with these silly goobers at comfort of your desk? Then this game is for you!  
  
Birds will spawn on your screen. Click them to add them to your collection!  
  
Keep track of the birds you collected with the Birdiary!  
  
Just like in real life, your collected birds will generate gold.  

Different birds have different degrees of rarity. Try and collect them all!

The rarer the bird, the better the gold they generate.
  
Use this gold to buy decoration to drip out your desktop and attract rarer birds!  
  
Buy the Froggy Fountain to become worthy of the bird who stands above all other birds...

# Technology
* Python / Flask
* PyGame
* Docker
* MongoDB
* Digital Ocean

# Future Expansion
* Add in more background options as a purchasable item, similar to furniture
* Carry over gamestate information to the other tabs in the website, allowing you to
view your bird collection, gold, furniture purchased, and other statistics
* Create more dynamic birds with animated assets 
* Establish bird behavior, allowing them to move to different locations instead of spawning in fixed locations
* Instead of using the mouse to collect birds, implement hand tracking ML to collect birds and put them in a bag
